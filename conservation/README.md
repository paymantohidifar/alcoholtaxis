In this anlaysis our goal was to study the conservation of amino-acid residues, more specifically the residue Ala431, within the principal ethanol sensing region on both the N- and C-helices of McpB homologs across all sequenced _Bacillus subtilis_ strains 

An informal description of all steps performed for the analysis is reported in `notes/notes.txt`.


Required tools  
---
>BLAST 2.10.1+
HMMER 3.3
MUSCLE v3.8.31
EMBOSS Needle (EMBL-EBI server)
Python (v-3.8)    
WebLogo 3 (online application)

Usage

>BLAST his were generated by runnig the bash script:
`$ bash find_hits.sh`.
All bioinformatics analysis were done by running the Python script:
`$ python conservaton.py`
